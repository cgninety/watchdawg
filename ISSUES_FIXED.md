# GPU Watchdog - Issues Found and Fixed

## Summary
The GPU watchdog program has been analyzed and several issues have been identified and fixed. The program now works correctly and includes proper error handling, type annotations, and Windows-specific batch scripts for easy deployment.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Type Annotation Issues
**Problem**: Multiple type annotation errors due to improper use of `None` as default for `List[str]`
```python
# BEFORE (Problematic)
trex_process_names: List[str] = None

# AFTER (Fixed)
trex_process_names: List[str] = field(default_factory=lambda: ["t-rex.exe", "trex.exe", "t-rex", "trex"])
```

**Fix Applied**: Used `dataclass.field()` with `default_factory` to properly initialize list defaults.

### 2. Unused Imports and Variables
**Problem**: Several unused imports and variables
- `Dict` import was unused
- `signal` import was unused after fixing Windows signal handling
- `gone` variable was unused in `psutil.wait_procs()`

**Fix Applied**: Removed unused imports and replaced unused variable with underscore.

### 3. Windows Signal Handling Issue
**Problem**: `CTRL_C_EVENT` signal handling doesn't work properly on Windows for most processes
```python
# BEFORE (Problematic)
proc.send_signal(signal.CTRL_C_EVENT)

# AFTER (Fixed)  
proc.terminate()  # More reliable on Windows
```

**Fix Applied**: Simplified to use `terminate()` which T-Rex should handle gracefully.

### 4. Error Handling Improvements
**Problem**: Limited error handling for nvidia-smi failures
- No check for nvidia-smi availability
- Poor handling of invalid temperature readings
- Generic error messages

**Fix Applied**: Added comprehensive error handling:
- Check for `FileNotFoundError` when nvidia-smi is not found
- Validate temperature strings before conversion to float
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios

### 5. Type Annotation for Collections
**Problem**: Type checker couldn't infer types for dynamically created lists
```python
# BEFORE (Problematic)
trex_processes = []
temps = []

# AFTER (Fixed)
trex_processes: List[psutil.Process] = []
temps: List[float] = []
```

**Fix Applied**: Added explicit type annotations for better type safety.

## Additional Improvements Made

### 1. Batch Scripts for Windows
Created `setup.bat` and `run_watchdog.bat` for easy deployment on Windows:
- `setup.bat`: Creates virtual environment and installs dependencies
- `run_watchdog.bat`: Runs the watchdog with proper error handling

### 2. Enhanced Temperature Validation
Improved temperature reading with better validation:
```python
if temp_str and temp_str.replace('.', '').isdigit():
    temps.append(float(temp_str))
```

### 3. Better Configuration Management
Fixed dataclass configuration to avoid `__post_init__` complexity.

## Current Status

✅ **All type annotation errors fixed**  
✅ **All unused imports/variables removed**  
✅ **Windows compatibility improved**  
✅ **Error handling enhanced**  
✅ **Deployment scripts added**  
✅ **Program tested and working**  

## Testing Results

The program has been tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ GPU temperature reading works (tested: 39°C)
- ✅ Configuration creation works
- ✅ Help system works
- ✅ All Python imports successful
- ✅ Type checking passes (minor warnings remain but are acceptable)

## Remaining Minor Type Warnings

Some type warnings remain but are acceptable:
- `psutil.process_iter()` return type is partially unknown (this is a limitation of the psutil library stubs)
- These do not affect functionality

## Usage Instructions

1. **Setup**: Run `setup.bat` to install dependencies
2. **Configuration**: Edit `gpu_watchdog_config.json` to adjust settings
3. **Run**: Use `run_watchdog.bat` or directly run with Python

The program is now production-ready for monitoring GPU temperature and gracefully shutting down T-Rex mining software when temperatures exceed the configured threshold.
